# 2024

This year i decided on rust cause why not! <br />
i'll use a workspace with a crate for each day for ease of solving.

## running the code

to run the file for each day use this command with the day number:

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It's important to run this command in the current folder (eg 2024/)
> for the crate to get the inputs correctly.

```bash
cargo run --release 01
```

## Inputs structure

inputs is organised in the input folder as follows `inputs/{day}/{part}.txt`,
so for the first day part 1 it's like inputs/01/1.txt.
